# Phase 10 — receiver playback telemetry admission gate

## Scope and trust boundary

This change adds a **pure Rust, constant-space admission gate** for later Worker→Service receiver playback telemetry. It does **not** create or activate a new IPC message, network sender, Teacher feed, authenticated credential, or adaptive-quality decision. It is intentionally independent of Astra's Phase 12 Windows trust, Registry anchor and IPC versioning work.

Before calling `ReceiverTelemetryGate::activate`, the eventual Service integration **must independently verify** its authenticated Worker pipe and current process, logon session, Worker generation, accepted presentation/stream ownership, installed key epoch and receiver-runtime generation. None of those can be asserted by a Worker-supplied report. A media report cannot activate its own binding. Exact binding change clears the previous baseline; identical activation preserves replay state. A matching clear revokes the gate; a stale clear cannot revoke a replacement.

`ReceiverTelemetryGate::observe` accepts only a nonzero monotonically increasing sequence from that exact binding and measures time on the Service's own monotonic clock. Reject replays, clock regression, malformed identity, counters decreasing and reports faster than 1 second, without advancing state. First sample, skipped sequences and time gaps above 30 seconds yield **Baseline**, never a fabricated valid quality interval. Contiguous, nonregressing counters yield separate authenticated AEAD opens, rejected opens, decoded frames, presented frames, errors, keyframe waits and receiver queue drop deltas. Memory remains O(1) per active gate; no content, keys or frame bytes are retained.

## Why this cannot yet drive automatic quality

Protected UDP sequence gaps are **observed ID discontinuities**, not definitive packet loss. AEAD-authenticated frames are **not** proof of decoding or display. Cumulative queue drops are **receiver-runtime-local**, not UDP loss. None of these local counters measures RTT or a true loss ratio; the gate deliberately returns neither synthetic RTT, packet-loss percentages nor a receiver health tier.

An **authenticated, version-negotiated Worker→Service telemetry IPC contract** is still required, including bounded sender rate, replay-resistant lifecycle, Service authorization, explicit drop behavior and revocation. Service→Teacher delivery needs its own mutually authenticated control-session correlation, bounded storage, independent per-receiver samples and safe adaptation policy. Phase 12 version changes must be coordinated before introducing message IDs. This feature stays passive until that integration and native Windows security qualification are complete.

## Regression and CI

`cargo test -p classmesh-control --test receiver_telemetry_admission` covers exact binding, stale Worker/runtime generations, replay, non-monotonic clocks, nonregressing counters, duplicate activation, revocation, too-frequent reporting, missing sequences, stale gaps and independently recorded authenticated/decoded/presented deltas.

The Remote Desktop Commander monthly limit prevented an **independent current-turn Windows VM2 rerun**. Prior tests for the earlier Worker watch dog do not validate this module. Require Rustfmt, all-targets warnings-denied Clippy, exact-head Portable Rust and Windows Build hosted CI. Preserve separate physical two-PC and classroom-congestion qualification gates. Do not treat hosted CI as physical evidence.
